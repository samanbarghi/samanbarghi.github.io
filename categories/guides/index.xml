      <description>I am taking a course called “Latency in Communication Systems” taught by Martin Karsten in University of Waterloo. We talked about different aspects of latency in communication systems, there were some lectures from industry (Sandvine, TD Securites, RIM, and SUN/Oracle) about what were the different problems they were facing during their system implementation. I had also presented two papers on profiling and router performance during the course. My course project is the reason I am writing this post, I have to install and evaluate SPDY.</description>
